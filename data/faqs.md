A: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.

Q: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?
A: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.

Q: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?
A: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.

Q: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?
A: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.

Q: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?
A: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.

Insulating Metal Panels (IMPs) are thermally insulated building components, composed of metal skins and a core, used to create the building envelope for roofs and walls.
IMPs, typically manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.
IMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.
This document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.
IMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.
PUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.
In the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.
After passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.
IMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.
Mineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.
PUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.
In planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.
Mineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.
The appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.
Dimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of "finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings".
Thermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.
The standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.
For IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to "finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).
The measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.
According to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.
The measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.
The allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.
The allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.
The allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.
The allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.
The allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.
The allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.
The allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.
The allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.
The allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.
The allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.
The allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.
Production-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.
The colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).
A perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.
The original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.
The RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.
The RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.
Color differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.
Color differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.
Each supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.
Color deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.
For repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.
If the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.
Customers have no claim for color identity.
When planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.
Manufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.
A batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.
The specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.
For unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.
If a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.
For heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.
For heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.
Particular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.
Buildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.
The interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.
Attention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.
For connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.
Ventilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.
IMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.
A structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.
The primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.
The thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.
The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.
The R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.
The selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.
The allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.
The minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.
Wind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.
The static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.
Snow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).
The snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.
Wind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.
Factors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.
For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.
A distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².
Permanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.
Variable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.
The structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.
IMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.
Temperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.
The load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.
The deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.
The allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.
The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.
For facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.
Local deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.
Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.
The amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.
IMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.
Lighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.
Darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.
Temperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.
The expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.
The expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.
If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.
For long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.
Mineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.
When mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.
The expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.
In heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.
Condensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.
Proper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.
Although most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.
Spacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.
The most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.
The inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.
A perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for "as tight as possible".
The exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.
The interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.
In interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.
The dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.
When the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.
Heat bridges initiate the condensation process.
Improperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.
The table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.
The condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.
Condensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.
Mineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.
The rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.
The air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.
The "Blower-Door" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.
The "Blower-Door" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.
The required "Blower-Door" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.
During a "Blower-Door" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.
The installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.
Installers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.
Installers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.
If an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.
Work should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.
Warnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.
The installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.
The installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.
The installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.
The installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.
Both installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.
The installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.
The installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.
The installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.
When installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.
The client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.
When ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.
For roof panels, "L" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and "R" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.
It is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.
Extremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.
Problems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.
For roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.
A detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.
The layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.
The layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.
The layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings
The installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.
A parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.
A parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.
When ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.
When ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.
It is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.
When ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.
For panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.
The installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.
Plan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.
Consider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.
Consider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.
Check if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.
Plan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.
Plan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.
Assess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.
All technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.
When storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.
Long-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.
Avoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.
Do not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.
Opened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.
When temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.
Confirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.
Use edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.
When lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.
Lift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.
When unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.
For cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.
For difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.
Do not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.
Minor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.
Touch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.
Most manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.
When installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.
When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.
If an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.
Misaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.
When working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.
It is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.
The installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.
The installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.
The installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.
Rainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.
If the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.
It is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.
When using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.
When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.
When cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.
When cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.
If a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.
Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.
For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.
When installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.
When using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.
When using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.
When using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.
For visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.
For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.
When installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.
For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or "panel press," to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.
When installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.
The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.
When planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.
For IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.
A spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.
Do not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.
Panel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.
Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.
When using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.
Drip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.
Snow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.
It is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.
For IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.
The top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.
For horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.
A properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.
For vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.
If there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.
The bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.
The bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.
For darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.
When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.
The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.
When using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.
A horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.
When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.
For window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).
The edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.
When using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.
Installers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.
When installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.
When using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.
When using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.
When installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.
When installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.
When creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.
For roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.
When installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.
Snow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.
When installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.
When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.
For firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.
The load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.
When performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.
When performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.
When using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.
The installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.
The proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.
Mineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.
The longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.
A vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.
For mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.
When installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.
If the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.
When making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.
A drip edge is required at the eave.
The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.
Thermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).
When using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.
Due to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.
A keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.
When planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.
When making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.
If fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.
The loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.
IMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.
A structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.
The brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.
Substructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.
Studs and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.
Bimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.
CE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.
Drip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.
Eaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.
Energy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.
Intumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.
OIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.
Purlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.
RAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.
U-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.
R-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.
Self-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.
Insulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.
IMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.
IMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.
The construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.
Aluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.
ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.
Polyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.
Thermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.
On exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.
"Reaction to fire" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.
ASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.
ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.
NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.
FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as "Class 1" (with or without a height restriction).
FM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.
FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as "Class 1".
FM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.
FM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.
FM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.
According to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.
According to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.
FM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.
FM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.
The insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.
FM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.
FM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.
FM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.
The FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.
FM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.
The FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.
Flashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.
Post-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.
The 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.
The 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.
Poorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.
The proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.
The IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.
NFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.
The installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.
Although IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.
NFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.
The NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.
In 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes "noncombustible" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.
NFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.
NFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.
NFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures
The observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.
A British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.
Building regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.
The specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.
The use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.
In most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.
FM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).
The test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.
It is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.
Case studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.
The fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.
FM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being "comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes."
FM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.
FM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).
FM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.
FM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.
FM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.
FM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.
FM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.
FM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.
