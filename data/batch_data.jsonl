assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners

intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

g/cm³.\n\nInsulating Metal Panels (IMPs) are thermally insulated building components, composed of metal skins and a core, used to create the building envelope for roofs and walls.\nIMPs, typically manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

For connections of Insulating Metal Panels (IMPs), special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal. Proper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes. Although most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation, the provided tapes are adequate. The inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion."}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"response_format":{"type":"json_object"},"metadata":{"conversation_id":"conv_01JKWW1P3W8ZFBRR1FJRDKSRTJ","question_id":"conv_01JKWW1P3W8ZFBRR1FJRDKSRTJ"}}}

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a transverse joint in an IMP roof?\nA: Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\n\nQ: What type of fire performance standards are required in smoke sensitive areas?\nA: In smoke sensitive areas, such as pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, FM 4882 classified IMPs are recommended.\n\nQ: What is a key element in properly designed roof penetrations in IMP systems?\nA: A proper thermal break is critical to prevent condensation and thermal bridging at roof penetrations.\n\nQ: What is the benefit of using a Hybrid PIR insulated panel system?\nA: They can provide a superior fire performance when compared to other combustible materials.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a thermoplastic and a thermoset foam?\nA: Thermoplastics melt and drip when exposed to heat, while thermosetting materials form a char layer which helps to reduce the spread of fire.\n\nQ: What are the components of a multi-story wall assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner

is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ:

When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

IMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system. Temperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems; however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support."}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"response_format":{"type":"json_object"},"metadata":{"conversation_id":"conv_01JKWW1NP55RNQHVWDBNNF96A0","question_id":"conv_01JKWW1NP55RNQHVWDBNNF96A0"}}}

assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners

intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

g/cm³.\n\nInsulating Metal Panels (IMPs) are thermally insulated building components, composed of metal skins and a core, used to create the building envelope for roofs and walls.\nIMPs, typically manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a

is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent

panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ:

rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is

assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also

tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

Here’s a breakdown of the weight for standard configurations with 0.5mm thickness on both the external and internal sides:\n\n| Panel Thickness (mm) | Weight (kg/m²) |\n|----------------------|----------------|\n| 30 mm                | 8.51 kg/m²     |\n| 40 mm                | 9.10 kg/m²     |\n| 50 mm                | 9.82 kg/m²     |\n| 60 mm                | 10.71 kg/m²    |\n| 80 mm                | 12.09 kg/m²    |\n| 100 mm               | 13.85 kg/m²    |\n| 120 mm               | 15.57 kg/m²    |\n| 150 mm               | 17.96 kg/m²    |\n| 200 mm               | 21.85 kg/m²    |\n\nFactors that affect the weight include the panel thickness, the type of metal facing, and the overall length of the panel. Thicker panels will naturally weigh more, and variations in the metal thickness will also contribute to the overall weight."}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"response_format":{"type":"json_object"},"metadata":{"conversation_id":"conv_01JKWW1MY0J7TZ6DN0W4QNGNB4","question_id":"conv_01JKWW1MY0J7TZ6DN0W4QNGNB4"}}}

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM

allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is

be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ:

rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

1:   \n\"user_question\":\"what type of fire reaction does globeroof eco offer?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The Globeroof Eco product offers a fire reaction that includes the formation of a protective layer when exposed to direct flame, which resists the spread of fire and self-extinguishes once the fire source is removed. This char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"the answer should be B-s2,d0; but this one is not completely wrong, it explains what happens when the fire attacks the PIR foam\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"partially_correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 2:\n\"user_question\":\"Can the insulated panel be used outdoors?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"Yes, insulated metal panels (IMPs) can be used outdoors. They are designed for constructing building envelopes for roofs and walls, providing weather protection and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"nailed it\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":true,\n      \"result\":\"correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 3:\n\"user_question\":\"How much does the panel weigh? (Obviously depending on the thickness)\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The weight of the Globe Roof insulated roofing panel will vary depending on the thickness of the steel gauge you choose. Here are the approximate weights for each thickness: For 0.4mm thickness: approximately 7.5 kg/m2. For 0.5mm thickness: approximately 9.0kg/m2. For 0.6mm thickness: approximately  10.5kg/m2. If you need further assistance or more specific details, feel free to ask!\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"Bot is responding with thickness of metal cladding, not thickness of the insulation core. Since the insulating core thickness is one of the primary features of an IMP, it should be assumed that its thickness is being asked about, not the metal cladding thickness.\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"incorrect\"\n   }\n\nQUESTION/ANSWER PAIR FOR EVALUATION:\n\n\nuser question: what type of fire resistance does globeroof PUR offer?\n\n\n\nbot answer: **GlobeRoof PUR Fire Resistance Information:**\n\n🚫 **GlobeRoof PUR (Polyurethane)** does not offer any fire resistance. \n\n### Key Points:\n- **Combustibility**: PUR foam is combustible and does not provide fire resistance ratings.\n- **Fire Performance**: It can ignite and contribute to flame spread if exposed to high temperatures or an open flame.\n- **Certification**: PUR panels do not achieve REI ratings (fire resistance classifications).\n\n### Alternatives for Fire Resistance:\n- For better fire resistance, consider **GlobeRoof PIR** (Polyisocyanurate), which achieves an **REI30** rating in the 100 mm version, or explore **GlobeRoof FireStop** (with a mineral wool core) for superior fire protection.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask!"}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"response_format":{"type":"json_object"},"metadata":{"conversation_id":"conv_01JKWW1MPE23W7M8SW9X8BRA9M","question_id":"conv_01JKWW1MPE23W7M8SW9X8BRA9M"}}}

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a transverse joint in an IMP roof?\nA: Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\n\nQ: What type of fire performance standards are required in smoke sensitive areas?\nA: In smoke sensitive areas, such as pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, FM 4882 classified IMPs are recommended.\n\nQ: What is a key element in properly designed roof penetrations in IMP systems?\nA: A proper thermal break is critical to prevent condensation and thermal bridging at roof penetrations.\n\nQ: What is the benefit of using a Hybrid PIR insulated panel system?\nA: They can provide a superior fire performance when compared to other combustible materials.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a thermoplastic and a thermoset foam?\nA: Thermoplastics melt and drip when exposed to heat, while thermosetting materials form a char layer which helps to reduce the spread of fire.\n\nQ: What are the components of a multi-story wall assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC profiles are designed to maintain cleanliness, prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, and provide a durable, easy-to-clean surface in areas like cold rooms, food processing plants, and

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is

assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

1:   \n\"user_question\":\"what type of fire reaction does globeroof eco offer?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The Globeroof Eco product offers a fire reaction that includes the formation of a protective layer when exposed to direct flame, which resists the spread of fire and self-extinguishes once the fire source is removed. This char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"the answer should be B-s2,d0; but this one is not completely wrong, it explains what happens when the fire attacks the PIR foam\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"partially_correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 2:\n\"user_question\":\"Can the insulated panel be used outdoors?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"Yes, insulated metal panels (IMPs) can be used outdoors. They are designed for constructing building envelopes for roofs and walls, providing weather protection and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"nailed it\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":true,\n      \"result\":\"correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 3:\n\"user_question\":\"How much does the panel weigh? (Obviously depending on the thickness)\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The weight of the Globe Roof insulated roofing panel will vary depending on the thickness of the steel gauge you choose. Here are the approximate weights for each thickness: For 0.4mm thickness: approximately 7.5 kg/m2. For 0.5mm thickness: approximately 9.0kg/m2. For 0.6mm thickness: approximately  10.5kg/m2. If you need further assistance or more specific details, feel free to ask!\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"Bot is responding with thickness of metal cladding, not thickness of the insulation core. Since the insulating core thickness is one of the primary features of an IMP, it should be assumed that its thickness is being asked about, not the metal cladding thickness.\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"incorrect\"\n   }\n\nQUESTION/ANSWER PAIR FOR EVALUATION:\n\n\nuser question: What is the noise reduction when using the acoustic panel?\n\nbot answer: The **GlobeRoof Noisestop** is our insulated sound-absorbing roofing panel designed specifically for effective noise reduction. Here are the key details regarding its acoustic performance:\n\n- **Acoustic Insulation**: The 80mm panel provides an acoustic insulation value of **33.6 dB**. This means it can significantly reduce the transmission of sound from one side of the panel to the other.\n- **Sound Absorption**: The same 80mm panel has a sound absorption coefficient of **0.8**, indicating its effectiveness in absorbing sound waves and reducing echo within a space.\n\nThese features make the GlobeRoof Noisestop an excellent choice for applications where noise control is a priority, such as in industrial buildings, warehouses, and commercial spaces.

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a transverse joint in an IMP roof?\nA: Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\n\nQ: What type of fire performance standards are required in smoke sensitive areas?\nA: In smoke sensitive areas, such as pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, FM 4882 classified IMPs are recommended.\n\nQ: What is a key element in properly designed roof penetrations in IMP systems?\nA: A proper thermal break is critical to prevent condensation and thermal bridging at roof penetrations.\n\nQ: What is the benefit of using a Hybrid PIR insulated panel system?\nA: They can provide a superior fire performance when compared to other combustible materials.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a thermoplastic and a thermoset foam?\nA: Thermoplastics melt and drip when exposed to heat, while thermosetting materials form a char layer which helps to reduce the spread of fire.\n\nQ: What are the components of a multi-story wall assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC profiles are designed to maintain cleanliness, prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, and provide a durable, easy-to-clean surface in areas like cold rooms, food processing plants, and

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ:

intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

1:   \n\"user_question\":\"what type of fire reaction does globeroof eco offer?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The Globeroof Eco product offers a fire reaction that includes the formation of a protective layer when exposed to direct flame, which resists the spread of fire and self-extinguishes once the fire source is removed. This char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"the answer should be B-s2,d0; but this one is not completely wrong, it explains what happens when the fire attacks the PIR foam\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"partially_correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 2:\n\"user_question\":\"Can the insulated panel be used outdoors?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"Yes, insulated metal panels (IMPs) can be used outdoors. They are designed for constructing building envelopes for roofs and walls, providing weather protection and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"nailed it\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":true,\n      \"result\":\"correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 3:\n\"user_question\":\"How much does the panel weigh? (Obviously depending on the thickness)\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The weight of the Globe Roof insulated roofing panel will vary depending on the thickness of the steel gauge you choose. Here are the approximate weights for each thickness: For 0.4mm thickness: approximately 7.5 kg/m2. For 0.5mm thickness: approximately 9.0kg/m2. For 0.6mm thickness: approximately  10.5kg/m2. If you need further assistance or more specific details, feel free to ask!\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"Bot is responding with thickness of metal cladding, not thickness of the insulation core.

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a transverse joint in an IMP roof?\nA: Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\n\nQ: What type of fire performance standards are required in smoke sensitive areas?\nA: In smoke sensitive areas, such as pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, FM 4882 classified IMPs are recommended.\n\nQ: What is a key element in properly designed roof penetrations in IMP systems?\nA: A proper thermal break is critical to prevent condensation and thermal bridging at roof penetrations.\n\nQ: What is the benefit of using a Hybrid PIR insulated panel system?\nA: They can provide a superior fire performance when compared to other combustible materials.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a thermoplastic and a thermoset foam?\nA: Thermoplastics melt and drip when exposed to heat, while thermosetting materials form a char layer which helps to reduce the spread of fire.\n\nQ: What are the components of a multi-story wall assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC profiles are designed to maintain cleanliness, prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, and provide a durable, easy-to-clean surface in areas like cold rooms, food processing plants, and

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

The following flashings are commonly used:\n\n1. **Ridge Flashing (External & Internal)**\n   - **Purpose:** Seals the ridge of the roof where two slopes meet, preventing water ingress and wind uplift.\n   - **Installation Details:** \n     - Internal Ridge Flashing is placed on the ridge purlin, with sealing tape applied before panel installation.\n     - External Ridge Flashing is placed over profile fillers and fixed with self-tapping screws into the panel ribs.\n\n2. **Eave Flashing**\n   - **Purpose:** Covers the exposed panel ends at the eaves to prevent water ingress and directs rainwater into the gutters.\n   - **Installation Details:** Sealed with butyl tape or silicone sealant. External eave masks are riveted to the facade for additional weather protection.\n\n3. **Gutter & Valley Flashing**\n   - **Purpose:** Ensures proper water drainage from the roof, used in internal gutters and valley junctions.\n   - **Installation Details:** Includes valley gutter support, thermal insulation, and sealing tapes. Panels near gutters require bent steel sheets for added protection.\n\n4. **Verge Flashing**\n   - **Purpose:** Protects the roof edges from wind-driven rain and uplift, providing a finished look at roof perimeters.\n   - **Installation Details:** Installed over panel ends and sealed with continuous butyl tape. Requires self-drilling screws through the ribs for secure attachment.\n\n5. **Snow Guard Flashing (Optional)**\n   - **Purpose:** Prevents snow from sliding off the roof dangerously, common in areas with heavy snowfall.\n   - **Installation Details:** Installed at the eaves and mid-roof sections using EPDM washers and pre-bent flashing sheets for protection.\n\n6. **Wall to Roof Flashing**\n   - **Purpose:** Seals the joint where GlobeRoof meets a vertical wall, preventing water penetration at intersections.\n   - **Installation Details:** Uses Z-shaped or L-shaped flashing, sealed with continuous butyl tape and additional fasteners.\n\n7. **Pipe Penetration & Roof Opening Flashing**\n   - **Purpose:** Seals around vents, chimneys, skylights, and pipe penetrations to prevent water leaks at roof openings.\n   - **Installation Details:** Prefabricated pipe collars or custom flashing sheets are used, requiring double-sealing with butyl tape and mechanical fasteners.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- Ensure all flashings are properly sealed with butyl or silicone sealant.\n- Use profile fillers where required to close panel gaps.\n\nThese flashings play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the GlobeRoof system, ensuring it withstands various weather conditions effectively."}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"response_format":{"type":"json_object"},"metadata":{"conversation_id":"ca0c3120-5b73-4b7c-979d-fb6c058cfec6","question_id":"ca0c3120-5b73-4b7c-979d-fb6c058cfec6"}}}

restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is

assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners

intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

Mineral wool panels, due to their characteristics, have a considerable mass, it is suggested to evaluate their dimensions in order to avoid problems related to excessive weight during the handling and assembly phases.\",\n      \"sample_questions\": [],\n      \"reviewed_by\": \"AI\",\n      \"status\": \"Pending\",\n      \"review_date\": \"2025-02-04T11:39:03.235Z\"\n    },\n    {\n

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a transverse joint in an IMP roof?\nA: Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\n\nQ: What type of fire performance standards are required in smoke sensitive areas?\nA: In smoke sensitive areas, such as pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, FM 4882 classified IMPs are recommended.\n\nQ: What is a key element in properly designed roof penetrations in IMP systems?\nA: A proper thermal break is critical to prevent condensation and thermal bridging at roof penetrations.\n\nQ: What is the benefit of using a Hybrid PIR insulated panel system?\nA: They can provide a superior fire performance when compared to other combustible materials.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a thermoplastic and a thermoset foam?\nA: Thermoplastics melt and drip when exposed to heat, while thermosetting materials form a char layer which helps to reduce the spread of fire.\n\nQ: What are the components of a multi-story wall assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC profiles are designed to maintain cleanliness, prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, and provide a durable, easy-to-clean surface in areas like cold rooms, food processing plants, and

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ:

intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

1:   \n\"user_question\":\"what type of fire reaction does globeroof eco offer?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The Globeroof Eco product offers a fire reaction that includes the formation of a protective layer when exposed to direct flame, which resists the spread of fire and self-extinguishes once the fire source is removed. This char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"the answer should be B-s2,d0; but this one is not completely wrong, it explains what happens when the fire attacks the PIR foam\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"partially_correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 2:\n\"user_question\":\"Can the insulated panel be used outdoors?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"Yes, insulated metal panels (IMPs) can be used outdoors. They are designed for constructing building envelopes for roofs and walls, providing weather protection and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"nailed it\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":true,\n      \"result\":\"correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 3:\n\"user_question\":\"How much does the panel weigh?

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time.\n\nQ: How does NFPA 285 relate to IMPs?\nA: NFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and is used to evaluate complete building systems and is required for multistory buildings.\n\nQ: What is the difference between FM 4880 and FM 4882 and what does it mean for my design?\nA: FM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance, and classifies these as \"Class 1\" with or without a height restriction, while FM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies and classifies these as “Class 1”.\n\nQ: What is the difference between reaction to fire and fire resistance?\nA: \"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests, whereas “fire resistance” relates to how well a construction assembly can withstand a fire over a specific period of time and is measured by tests like the ASTM E119.\n\nQ: What are some key points to consider about expansion and contraction in IMPs?\nA: The installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints and the bimetal effect should be considered.\n\nQ: What is the bimetal effect and how does it affect IMP installations?\nA: The bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other, which can lead to warping or buckling of the panels if the movement is restricted.\n\nQ: What is the maximum permissible deflection on an IMP roof?\nA: The maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200, where L is the length of the span, and for facades and walls, a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\n\nQ: What is the best method for cutting IMPs in the field?\nA: It is recommended to avoid the use of angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade, and immediately remove any metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\n\nQ: When should self-drilling fasteners be avoided and what type of fastener is preferred?\nA: When using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress, and in most other cases, screws with supporting threads are preferred.\n\nQ: What must be done to ensure proper water runoff?\nA: Always install drip edges at the eaves, ensure a pitch that allows water runoff, and design systems that prevent water buildup on horizontal joints.\n\nQ: When is it important to seal the cut edges of panels?\nA: The cut edges of mineral wool panels must be sealed to prevent moisture penetration and rust.\n\nQ: How must IMPs be stored on a job site?\nA: IMPs must be stored on a level surface, tilted to allow for water drainage, and stacked with a breathable tarp covering them to prevent damage and moisture buildup.\n\nQ: What is the proper installation of IMPs in areas that require fire-resistant construction?\nA: IMPs with a mineral wool core should be used, with a proper fire rated supporting structure, and where applicable expansion joints should be installed.\n\nQ: What are the dangers of improper joints on IMPs?\nA: Improper joints on IMPs can create condensation, water ingress, and thermal bridges, and can lead to structural and thermal failure of the building envelope.\n\nQ: How do you calculate the required number of fasteners for IMPs?\nA: The number of fasteners is determined using wind load calculations and the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nQ: What is a common cause of water ingress at the joints of IMPs?\nA: A lack of proper sealing, which includes a reliance on sealants in place of a proper mechanical design, are a common source of water ingress.\n\nQ: When is a \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" needed?\nA: A \"\"Blower Door Test\"\" is sometimes required when building a heated space, in order to get an energy performance certificate.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for securing IMPs on a job site during installation?\nA: When installing IMPs, it is important to use safety equipment, proper lifting equipment, and never allow people to stand under the load.\n\nQ: What is a proper way to construct an IMP for a horizontal wall?\nA: A proper base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels, where the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\n\nQ: How does proper use of sealant help with long term performance of IMP?\nA: When using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\n\nQ: What kind of metal fasteners should be used for a panel used in an environment with exposure to salt?\nA: Fasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\n\nQ: Why should IMP's at the eaves of a building have free space?\nA: IMPs should be free to move, especially when in areas that are susceptible to ice buildup.\n\nQ: What is the responsibility of the installer?\nA: The installer is responsible for reviewing all plans and ensuring the substructure is fit for purpose, and for following the manufacturers directions for install.\n\nQ: What is a good practice for a transverse joint in an IMP roof?\nA: Transverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\n\nQ: What type of fire performance standards are required in smoke sensitive areas?\nA: In smoke sensitive areas, such as pharmaceutical and food processing facilities, FM 4882 classified IMPs are recommended.\n\nQ: What is a key element in properly designed roof penetrations in IMP systems?\nA: A proper thermal break is critical to prevent condensation and thermal bridging at roof penetrations.\n\nQ: What is the benefit of using a Hybrid PIR insulated panel system?\nA: They can provide a superior fire performance when compared to other combustible materials.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a thermoplastic and a thermoset foam?\nA: Thermoplastics melt and drip when exposed to heat, while thermosetting materials form a char layer which helps to reduce the spread of fire.\n\nQ: What are the components of a multi-story wall assembly that is tested with NFPA 285?\nA: A multistory wall assembly must be made of components such as the IMPs, any vapor barrier, insulation, framing, joint sealants and the wall covering materials.\n\nQ: What does the \"\"FM Approval\"\" mean for IMP systems?\nA: The FM Approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control procedures, and FM Approved IMPs can provide the same level of protection as non-combustible cladding systems.\n\nQ: What test is used to simulate real fire conditions with IMPs?\nA: The 50-ft corner test as part of FM 4880 uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\n\nQ: What is a key to ensuring the fire resistance of an assembly with IMPs?\nA: Penetrations in IMP systems, when improperly installed can undermine fire performance, and a range of certified seals are available and should be used for up to 30 and 60 minutes of fire resistance.\n\nQ: What must be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the fire tests with IMPs?\nA: The fire test aims to prove the ability of the panels to prevent the spread of fire beyond the area of ignition.\n\nQ: What types of fasteners should be used when installing an IMP system with a concrete sub-structure?\nA: For connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\n\nQ: What is the danger when the IMP exterior panel is constrained?\nA: If the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\n\nQ: When should you specify fire rated penetration seals in an IMP system?\nA: When installing penetrations in IMPs, always ensure that certified penetration seals are used in order to achieve the intended fire resistance.\n\nQ: Should a sub-structure of a fire-rated system be built from the same material as the IMP?\nA: The substructure of a fire rated system should always be made of a fire rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC profiles are designed to maintain cleanliness, prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, and provide a durable, easy-to-clean surface in areas like cold rooms, food processing plants, and

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

the basic components of an Insulated Metal Panel (IMP)?\nA: IMPs consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating, and a core of insulating material such as polyurethane (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), expanded polystyrene (EPS), or other materials.\n\nQ: Besides cold storage, where else can IMPs be used?\nA: IMPs are versatile and used in industrial, residential, and administrative buildings, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\n\nQ: What kind of certifications do IMPs need to have?\nA: IMPs in Europe need to adhere to CE-marking requirements, and must comply with EN 14509.\n\nQ: What is the difference between a U-Value and an R-Value in IMPs?\nA: The U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material, where a lower value indicates better thermal insulation, and the R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow, where a higher value indicates better thermal insulation.\n\nQ: Which core material provides better load bearing capabilities?\nA: IMPs with a polyurethane (PUR) core tend to provide greater load bearing capabilities and more structural rigidity than mineral wool (MIWO) IMPs.\n\nQ: What is the main fire risk with ACM cladding panels and how do they differ from IMPs?\nA: ACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, which is highly flammable, and ACM panels do not offer any insulation, as they are used purely for aesthetic purposes.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of ASTM E84 testing and what does it tell us about a building product?\nA: ASTM E84 is used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the ASTM E119 test?\nA: The ASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its

be done when cutting IMPs and creating a transverse joint at the eave of a building?\nA: The exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece, and a drip edge should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\n\nQ: Why should one avoid using angle grinders when cutting IMPs?\nA: Angle grinders create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, a hand circular saw with a carbide blade should be used.\n\nQ: How are IMPs used in interior partition walls?\nA: For interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\n\nQ: How should connections to windows be done?\nA: When making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame, and the edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant.\n\nQ: Why is it important to have a detailed layout plan prior to IMP installations?\nA: A detailed layout plan is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging, and should also include all information about accessories and fasteners.\n\nQ: What is the main goal of the \"\"Blower Door\"\" test?\nA: The goal of the “Blower Door” test is to provide a measure for the air tightness/leakage of a building.\n\nQ: Why does temperature matter for IMPs?\nA: It has an effect on the expansion and contraction of the IMPs, also affects the dew point and where condensation will occur.\n\nQ: How should the connection of mineral wool panels be handled for fire resistant purposes?\nA: When using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors, and you must take into account the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\n\nQ: Should purlins be directly installed on top of supporting beams?\nA: Purlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow for even deflection of the IMPs.\n\nQ: Should snow guards be installed directly below a transverse joint?\nA: Snow guards should not be installed directly below a transverse joint in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\n\nQ: When using visible fasteners, what is the correct way to install them?\nA: For visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\n\nQ: How do I avoid causing damage when lifting panels?\nA: When lifting roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\n\nQ: What is important about the order of operation of installing panels?\nA: When installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints, because if an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it, which will lead to water ingress.\n\nQ: How does using a panel lifter benefit IMP installers?\nA: For very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\n\nQ:

rated material as well.\n\nQ: When should you use metal trim to finish the edge of an IMP?\nA: When installing IMPs in a roof, the exposed side of the IMP at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece to ensure proper sealing.\n\nQ: Should you use sealants alone to create a water resistant connection?\nA: While sealants can help with water resistance, mechanical joints should be designed to avoid water intrusion in the first place.\n\nQ: How does a char layer help prevent fire spread?\nA: On exposure to a direct flame, the hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\nQ: Why is it important to ensure IMPs have proper airflow?\nA: Proper airflow is needed to prevent condensation, where the interior seal must be a vapor barrier to stop moist air from penetrating the system, and the exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion outwards.\n\nQ: What is the relation between an IMP's color and fire performance?\nA: The color impacts the temperature of the panel due to the bimetal effect where darker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of hygienic PVC profiles in industrial settings?\nA: Hygienic PVC

manufactured in continuous production facilities, consist of an inner and outer shell of galvanized steel with a protective coating.\nIMPs are versatile and used in various construction sectors, including industrial, cold storage, and residential, as well as for cladding and enclosures of machinery, control rooms, and offices.\nThis document is a guideline, but proper detailing for IMP installation requires a combination of knowledge in IMPs, metalwork, roofing, building physics, and structural analysis, not just this document alone.\nIMPs, belonging to the category of composite elements, have an insulating core of either polyurethane foam (PUR), mineral wool (MIWO), or sometimes styrofoam, which is bonded to metal skins that provide both load bearing capacity, and thermal insulation.\nPUR foam, a product of an exothermic chemical reaction from components like polyol, polyisocyanate, and blowing agents, provides good thermal performance; 50 mm of PUR foam is equivalent to 1720 mm of brick in terms of thermal performance.\nIn the manufacturing process of IMPs, the surfaces of the steel sheets are cleaned with a high-frequency corona discharge before the protective films are applied to the exterior, or both surfaces, followed by shaping by roll formers, and the application of PUR foam or an adhesive coating to the bottom sheet while the top sheet is mechanically held in place, and then the IMP passes through a heated tunnel to bond.\nAfter passing through a heated tunnel, the IMP is cut to length by a flying saw and the cut edges are protected using a cathodic protection method where zinc dissolves to protect the exposed steel, however, these edges should not be permanently exposed to moisture.\nIMPs have properties such as good structural stability, weather resistance, attractive profiles and colors, and excellent thermal insulation, and must adhere to CE-marking in Europe, in compliance with the European NORM EN 14509, yet they must not be used as load-bearing structural members.\nMineral wool IMPs, which have a fire-resistance rating greater than 1000°C, use hydrophobized and compressed mineral wool in strips, where the lower sheet is coated with adhesive, the strips are applied at 90 degree rotation along with moisture barrier plastic films, and then the second sheet is applied with adhesive, and are heavier and less structurally rigid than PUR IMPs, thus requiring more care in handing with vacuum suction lifters.\nPUR IMPs, which are more compact and stable than mineral wool IMPs, use a PUR foam core that is not moisture sensitive and are less expensive.\nIn planning the installation of IMPs, it is important to choose the correct material based on factors such as; wind and snow loads, roof pitch, interior and exterior colors, material coatings, thermal expansion, thermal insulation, roof spans, penetrations, connection types, roof purlin materials, and attachment points.\nMineral wool IMPs require proper connection detailing to avoid water intrusion, where unsealed cut edges can create moisture problems at locations like roof penetrations, light domes, and eaves and therefore, all areas must be sealed to the level of a vapor barrier, while also planning for exterior drainage holes to prevent trapped water.\nThe appearance of mineral wool and PUR IMPs can differ in certain light conditions because of differences in core density which can flatten micro-sicken during manufacturing, as well as by differing levels of moisture absorption.\nDimensional tolerances for IMPs are governed by ÖNORM DIN 18202, which specifies tolerances for building construction, where IMPs fall under the category of \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings, e.g. plastered walls, wall coverings, suspended ceilings\".\nThermally induced waviness is to be expected in IMPs, with light reflections emphasizing any unevenness, especially on new, glossy surfaces.\nThe standard ÖNORM DIN 18202 defines acceptable limits for unevenness, based on the measurement point distances, for IMPs.\nFor IMPs, the tolerances for flatness deviations apply to \"finished surfaces for walls and undersides of ceilings\" with the largest deviations allowed at distances of 15m (30 mm).\nThe measurement point distances for determining unevenness are defined by ÖNORM DIN 18202.\nAccording to EN 14509 (Self-supporting sandwich elements with metal faces), manufacturers' tolerances apply only to factory production control (WPK), not to field measurements.\nThe measurement methods, environment and the fixing of measurement points for tolerances in IMP manufacturing are defined by EN 14509.\nThe allowed tolerances for IMP thickness are ±2 mm for IMPs equal to or less than 100 mm thick, and ±2% for IMPs greater than 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for flatness deviation of an IMP depend on the measuring length and range from 0.6mm for a 200mm length, up to 1.5mm for a length over 700 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the height of metal profiles in an IMP (Gurte) range from ±1mm for profile heights of 5 to 50mm, to ± 2.5mm for profile heights between 50 and 100 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the depth of corrugations in an IMP is ±30% of depth for depth ≤1 mm, ±0.3 mm for depths between 1 and 3mm, and ±10% for depths between 3 and 5 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for the length of an IMP is ±5 mm for lengths up to 3m, and ± 10 mm for lengths over 3 m.\nThe allowed tolerance for the width of an IMP is ± 2mm.\nThe allowed tolerance for squareness of an IMP is 0.006 times the panel width.\nThe allowed tolerance for straightness of an IMP is 1mm per meter in length and no more than 5 mm total.\nThe allowed tolerance for IMP curvature is 2mm per meter length and up to 10 mm total for grooved and flat sheet and 10mm per meter width and up to a total of 16mm for profiled sheets.\nThe allowed tolerance for profile grid is ± 2mm when the profile height is less than or equal to 50 mm, and ± 3 mm when the profile height is greater than 50 mm.\nThe allowed tolerances for width of the upper bead of an IMP is ± 1 mm, while the lower bead is ± 2 mm.\nProduction-related and unavoidable bowing (Querwölbung) of IMPs can occur, due to different thermal behaviors of the outer and inner surfaces, but can be flattened by screws to the purlins, and will flatten naturally over time which may require tightening after 1.5 to 2 years.\nThe colors of IMPs are specified using the RAL color system (Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung).\nA perfect color match of IMPs is not always possible due to production factors.\nThe original RAL register cards should be used as a basis for color comparisons.\nThe RAL institute does not monitor the production of products according to the RAL color charts.\nThe RAL institute does not specify any color tolerances because they vary between industries.\nColor differences can occur between IMP deliveries due to the use of different steel coils.\nColor differences are not a valid reason for a complaint, so ordering extra IMPs for replacements is recommended when initially placing an order.\nEach supplier of coated steel for IMPs defines a tolerance (ΔE) for color deviations that the IMP manufacturer has no control over.\nColor deviations of ΔE < 1 are within tolerance, as per DIN 6174-15 ΔE.\nFor repeat orders, inform the IMP manufacturer or dealer about the importance of color matching so that they can attempt to make your order from the same coil and batch.\nIf the same coil or batch is no longer available, color matching cannot be guaranteed.\nCustomers have no claim for color identity.\nWhen planning the order of facade IMPs, contact your supplier and note the need for consistent color, so that the same color and batch of coating is used.\nManufacturers use several steel suppliers for consistency of production and delivery which may have slight color variations despite adhering to RAL color.\nA batch of coating is a unique mixture which cannot be exactly duplicated, which can lead to slight color differences even within the same RAL color code between different batches from the same coating supplier.\nThe specific use of a building, along with its internal emissions, must be thoroughly considered when selecting IMPs for the building envelope.\nFor unheated, only tempered (max +5°C) buildings, minimal sealing is necessary and an energy performance certificate is not required.\nIf a building is to be used for machinery, equipment, or vehicle storage, extensive sealing for high vapor tightness is not necessary.\nFor heated buildings, proper sealing is required and an energy performance certificate is necessary according to OIB-Guideline 6.\nFor heated buildings, specific sealing materials and details must be planned and executed according to OIB guideline 6.\nParticular attention to building use is required for production facilities, heated sales areas, administrative buildings, catering facilities, sports halls, and heated high temperature buildings.\nBuildings with high levels of internal humidity (such as laundries, slaughterhouses, and greenhouses) require specific considerations for IMPs.\nThe interior surface of IMPs forms the vapor barrier of the building envelope.\nAttention must be paid to proper fitting of IMPs and manufacturers' specification regarding maximal allowed joint widths should be followed.\nFor connections of IMPs, special closed cell sealant tapes are used to provide a vapor-tight seal.\nVentilation systems must be equipped with a dehumidification unit to maintain humidity at around 60%.\nIMPs, when properly installed and sealed, result in a very airtight and energy-efficient building envelope.\nA structural analysis must be provided for the selected IMPs and their fasteners, specifying manufacturer and type in the layout plan.\nThe primary criteria for choosing IMP thickness are the load requirements (based on structural needs) and the level of thermal insulation needed.\nThe thickness of the core of an IMP has a significant influence on the U-value and the load-bearing capacity against wind and snow loads.\nThe U-value measures the rate of heat transfer through a material; a lower U-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe R-value measures a material's resistance to heat flow; a higher R-value indicates better thermal insulation.\nThe selection of IMPs should take into account the building codes requiring specific R-values or U-values for the building envelope.\nThe allowed load for specific IMP types can be obtained from the manufacturer.\nThe minimum bearing width must be taken into account in the region of the purlins at the walls and roof.\nWind and snow loads must be calculated according to ÖNORM EN 1991-1-3 and ÖNORM EN 1991-1-4 respectively.\nThe static calculation of IMPs should be done according to EN 1990, taking into consideration structural stability and serviceability.\nSnow loads should be obtained from the regional building codes or the national register for snow and ice loads (www.conkret.at).\nThe snow load calculation should account for snow drifts on roofs.\nWind loads are determined by considering the wind pressure used to determine panel thickness, and the suction force used to determine the number and type of fasteners.\nFactors influencing wind load calculations include roof type, terrain category, building location, building dimensions, and openings.\nFor interior partition walls, the required IMP thickness is determined by the support spacing and the number of fasteners.\nA distinction is made between permanent and variable loads, which are always measured in kN/m².\nPermanent loads include the weight of the panels, solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, and suspended building services.\nVariable loads include wind, snow, local snow accumulations, and thermal loads based on color group.\nThe structural system of the IMPs can be a single span beam, double span beam, or multi-span beam.\nIMPs in a single-span beam system have greater load bearing capacity than in a double-span system.\nTemperature changes do not affect the load bearing capacity of single-span IMP systems, however, with multi-span systems, temperature changes can induce additional forces at the mid support.\nThe load bearing capacity (Tragfähigkeit) of an IMP is higher in the middle of a span than at the support point, due to interactions with support forces.\nThe deflection of IMPs due to gravity and applied loads must be considered, and limited by code to prevent long-term deformation and damage to sealant.\nThe allowable deflection of an IMP is proportional to the span.\nThe maximum allowed deflection for roofs only intended for maintenance is L/200.\nFor facades and walls there are no specified regulations, but a deflection limit of L/150 is recommended to protect the sealing at the connections.\nLocal deflection of IMPs must not be restricted by supports at the same level as the roof binder because it can create excessive stress, water intrusion, and cause fasteners to fail.\nPurlins should be placed above the roof binder to allow even deflection of IMPs.\nThe amount of bending of an IMP is dependent on the length of the span, the color of the exterior surface, and the temperature change.\nIMPs are categorized into three color groups based on their darkness and their heat absorption ability.\nLighter colored IMPs reflect more heat than darker colored IMPs.\nDarker colors will absorb more heat and experience more expansion than lighter colors.\nTemperature differences between Cobalt Blue and White can be up to 50°C, where PUR foam acts as a buffer between the two surfaces.\nThe expansion of a dark colored panel can be larger than that of a light colored panel, and should be taken into consideration during installation.\nThe expansion of the exterior panel of an IMP can be different than that of the interior panel, thus an effect called the bimetal effect needs to be considered.\nIf the expansion of IMPs is constrained by rigid connections, then the exterior panel may buckle or crease.\nFor long or dark colored panels, a panel lifter is recommended to aid in installation.\nMineral wool IMPs are generally used for fire protection purposes.\nWhen mineral wool IMPs are installed on multi-story buildings, fire-resistant expansion joints or intumescent strips should be installed near the floors.\nThe expansion joints need to account for the bimetal effect, which can lead to a gap of 20-60mm between floors.\nIn heated buildings, higher interior temperatures create higher vapor pressure than exterior temperatures which pushes air outwards, while warmer air holds more moisture than colder air.\nCondensation occurs when warm, moist air reaches its dew point.\nProper sealing of connections to other building components is critical to prevent condensation, using sealed foils or specific adhesive tapes, where IMPs in usual construction are considered to be vapor-tight.\nAlthough most IMPs have closed-cell sealing tapes in their joints, they are not entirely diffusion-tight, but with proper installation the provided tapes are adequate.\nSpacers are often used to properly align panels, but attention must be given to product-specific tolerances.\nThe most difficult part of creating a proper seal is the connections to other building components.\nThe inside of a building should be sealed as tightly as possible, while the outside should be sealed only as much as is necessary to allow for outward diffusion.\nA perfect seal is not possible in building construction, so you should aim for \"as tight as possible\".\nThe exterior seal should allow for vapor diffusion out, but prevent rainwater or spray from entering.\nThe interior seal should prevent moist air from entering the structure, and should be a vapor barrier to stop condensation.\nIn interior spaces with overpressure from ventilation systems, there is less risk of moisture intrusion, and Dichtband Type 5, 6, 7, or 10 should be used.\nThe dew point is the temperature at which air saturated with water vapor will condense.\nWhen the temperature of air decreases, its ability to hold water vapor decreases, increasing the relative humidity until it reaches the dew point, at which time condensation will occur.\nHeat bridges initiate the condensation process.\nImproperly joined roof panels due to too-wide gaps, which prevent proper compression of the sealant, will create heat bridges and condensation.\nThe table provided (Taupunkttabelle) shows the dew point for different temperatures and relative humidity values.\nThe condensation process will continue as long as the conditions for it exist, where with improper installation, it can take place for extended periods of time.\nCondensation can run along the panel joints and drip from the purlins.\nMineral wool IMPs are especially susceptible to moisture damage when condensation occurs.\nThe rate of air exchange (n50) measures how many times the air volume in a building is exchanged per hour at a pressure difference of 50 Pa.\nThe air exchange rate (n50) for buildings with mechanical ventilation must be less than 1.5/h and for buildings without mechanical ventilation, the rate must be below 3/h.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test uses a fan to create a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a building to measure its airtightness.\nThe \"Blower-Door\" test is sometimes needed in order to get an energy performance certificate.\nThe required \"Blower-Door\" test for building envelopes depends on the type of building and its usage.\nDuring a \"Blower-Door\" test, all openings in the building are sealed, and a fan creates a pressure difference, which is used to measure the amount of air flow, thereby determining the air-tightness.\nThe installer of IMPs often has the most responsibility because they are the last in a long chain of people involved in a project.\nInstallers must conduct inspections and raise concerns about potential issues, and this responsibility begins in the quoting stage.\nInstallers have a duty to inspect the work of others that precedes their own, to identify defects that might negatively affect the quality of the installation.\nIf an installer recognizes a potential problem with the design or preparation that may lead to issues later, they must issue a written warning to the client.\nWork should not begin until all open issues are clarified and a written record is created.\nWarnings should be issued in writing and sent by registered mail, in addition to fax or email.\nThe installer has a responsibility to review all provided documents and instructions for the project.\nThe installer has a responsibility to confirm the condition of all materials and work that has been completed before they begin their work.\nThe installer is not responsible for extensive or difficult testing to uncover defects, but has a duty to notify the client of anything that is obviously not adequate.\nThe installer has a duty to provide input and suggestions for improving the work if necessary.\nBoth installer and client are liable for the consequences if communication is lacking or if the installer continues despite receiving no response from the client about concerns they raised.\nThe installer is relieved of liability for problems if they raise a concern, the client does not heed the warning, and the problem occurs.\nThe installer must inspect the substructure to be certain that it is flat, level, and plumb, before proceeding with the installation.\nThe installer has a responsibility to notify the client of any requirement for snow guards.\nWhen installing IMPs for roofing, always work against the prevailing wind direction, and determine the prevailing wind direction by consulting with the client.\nThe client should be asked about the prevailing wind direction, and their response should be recorded in writing.\nWhen ordering IMPs, note the required cut direction (left or right) to ensure the correct overlapping is used.\nFor roof panels, \"L\" indicates overlapping from the left when facing the roof, and \"R\" indicates overlapping from the right when facing the roof.\nIt is generally preferable to avoid installing extremely long IMPs, due to increased risk of damage during transport and installation.\nExtremely long IMPs may have expansion and contraction issues due to thermal dilation as they are constrained by fasteners to the substructure, and these issues can be compounded by the bimetal effect where the interior and exterior skins of the panel expand and contract at different rates.\nProblems arising from the thermal effects of long IMPs include, but are not limited to:  noise, and a loss of airtightness and seal integrity at connections and attachments.\nFor roofs, it is better to install transverse joints and, for horizontal wall or facade panels, to install joints at appropriate intervals to accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction effects.\nA detailed layout plan with a corresponding parts list is necessary before beginning work, including position numbers that are marked on the layout plan, parts list, and the packaging.\nThe layout plan must specify the correct installation direction of the panels.\nThe layout plan should indicate panel length, purlin spacing, wind loads, and the type and quantity of fasteners.\nThe layout plan should also specify the placement and type of accessories and flashings\nThe installer should check the work area and sub structure, and then distribute the IMPs according to the layout plans, trying to keep them close to the installation area to optimize workflow.\nA parts list should correspond with the layout plan and include position numbers, also known as axis designations.\nA parts list and layout plan should match and include all information about accessories and fasteners to prevent delays and incorrect installations.\nWhen ordering, the part list and layout plan must be cross checked and signed by the client and the manufacturer.\nWhen ordering, pay attention to the cost of shorter panel lengths and consider whether to cut the panels on site instead.\nIt is recommended to order the transverse cuts for overlaps and the cuts for the eaves pre-made by the manufacturer, in order to save time.\nWhen ordering precut panels, specify the cuts as left or right.\nFor panel installations, ensure that the purlin tops are slightly higher than the top of the roof binders to allow for proper deflection of the panels, and if not, the purlin spacing should be reduced by half or more.\nThe installation of IMPs should not be done if the purlins are on the same level as the roof binders or if the spans are at the maximum, as this will prevent correct panel deflection, and in this case, the client must be informed, and a new plan for attachment must be prepared before continuing the work.\nPlan the work to be efficient, where a good plan avoids costs and conflicts; this should include site access, sub-structures, storage of panels, safety equipment, and climate considerations.\nConsider if the site access and surroundings are adequate, and if access for machinery is appropriate.\nConsider if the purlins will be provided by others, or if they are included in the quotation.\nCheck if a storage area is available and is suitable for storing IMPs, and is free from hazards.\nPlan if safety netting is included for roof panel assembly, and if any edge protection is needed for the project.\nPlan what kind of edge protection or fall protection will be used and who will be providing it.\nAssess the weather conditions for the time of the work, and if there are potential difficulties due to cold weather, where shorter daylight hours and issues with sealing products can be a problem.\nAll technical details should be clarified prior to starting the job, along with identifying the prevailing wind direction.\nWhen storing IMPs, always stack them with a lengthwise tilt to allow for drainage and prevent water buildup.\nLong-term storage of IMPs in the open requires covering them with breathable tarps (not plastic), to allow for ventilation.\nAvoid storing IMPs in a manner that allows standing water between the panels, as this can lead to damage, such as stains, corrosion, or white rust.\nDo not stack IMP packages on top of each other to prevent pressure points on the panels.\nOpened packages of IMPs should be secured against wind to prevent panels from being blown away.\nWhen temporarily storing panels on a roof structure, place them only over purlins, not in the middle of a span, for safety reasons.\nConfirm the load bearing capacity of the roof with the structural engineer before placing materials on the roof.\nUse edge protectors under lifting slings when using cranes to lift IMPs.\nWhen lifting IMPs longer than 8 meters, always use a lifting beam.\nLift only one package of IMPs at a time with a crane.\nWhen unloading IMPs with a forklift, ensure the driver acts carefully and the fork spacing is as wide as possible, and consider using two forklifts when unloading long panels.\nFor cleaning IMPs with a polyester coating, use water and a soft brush, or a pressure washer at a maximum of 50 bar pressure with cold water.\nFor difficult-to-remove stains, use a pH-neutral detergent diluted with water, or use ethanol, but rinse with water immediately afterwards.\nDo not use acidic or alkaline cleaners on polyester-coated IMPs.\nMinor scratches on IMP surfaces can be touched up with a small brush using a paint that is compatible with galvanized surfaces and has the same RAL color.\nTouch-up work on metallic IMP finishes is difficult and may not result in a perfect color match.\nMost manufacturers apply a self-adhesive protective film to IMPs, which should be removed before or immediately after installation, as long exposure to UV light will make them difficult to remove.\nWhen installing roof panels, use vacuum lifters or mechanical lifting clamps and avoid lifting panels using straps on their edges, which will deform the panel edges.\nWhen installing panels, always ensure proper alignment and fit of the panel joints.\nIf an IMP roof is improperly installed and the panel joints are misaligned, there is no possibility of later correcting it.\nMisaligned joints in IMP roofs lead to water ingress.\nWhen working on a roof, use fall protection, including helmets, lifelines, and other safety equipment.\nIt is forbidden to walk or stand under lifted loads, and lifting equipment should be certified and inspected annually.\nThe installer is responsible for the visual inspection of purlins and other substructure elements, and should confirm that they are properly installed, dimensioned, and meet the requirements of the plan.\nThe installer has the responsibility to verify that the purlins are level, plumb, and straight with appropriate measuring tools before installing the panels.\nThe installer is responsible to check that the bearing width of the purlins match the requirements.\nRainwater and condensation should be allowed to flow away from the panels unobstructed.\nIf the roof panels are installed such that the purlins block the flow, there is a risk of water ingress, so the installer should ensure proper support and panel deflection.\nIt is the installers responsibility to ensure that any attachments such as snow guards are placed correctly and that they do not cause water ingress issues.\nWhen using sealants for IMP connections, they must be compatible with IMP materials and be durable.\nWhen using durable sealants, ensure they are installed correctly and protected from the sun where necessary.\nWhen cutting IMPs, avoid using angle grinders, which create hot sparks that can damage the coating and create rust points; instead, use a hand circular saw with a carbide blade.\nWhen cutting IMPs, immediately remove all metal shavings from the panel surface to prevent rust.\nIf a manufacturer's guidelines specify the use of spanless self-tapping screws, use those, and for all other cases use screws with supporting threads and ensure the drilling process is conducted without producing shavings.\nFasteners used in IMP installation should be corrosion resistant, with specific fasteners used when the environment has increased corrosives.\nFor connections to concrete, use approved concrete screws, and follow manufacturer's guidelines for hole diameter and screw depth.\nWhen installing fasteners into concrete, it is permissible to use data from on-site tests to specify the number of fasteners, where a test is to be done on 15 points, and the average of the 5 smallest should be used.\nWhen using power tools to install fasteners, make sure the setting is correct.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, the fasteners are installed in the lap joint.\nWhen using concealed fasteners, make sure the panels are aligned correctly to prevent warping at the ends.\nFor visible fasteners, the heads of the screws should be aligned in straight, parallel rows.\nFor visible fasteners, use screws with support threads and make sure the screw head is completely pressed into the gasket to ensure a good seal.\nWhen installing fasteners, avoid over tightening or under tightening.\nFor very long IMPs, it is recommended to use an IMP installation tool, or \"panel press,\" to simplify the process, as it will prevent warping of the panels when connecting them.\nWhen installing IMPs on multi-story buildings with mineral wool IMPs, leave a gap between floors, and install fire-resistant expansion joints and intumescent strips.\nThe installer should always take into account the thermal expansion of the IMPs and make sure the system allows for it to move, such as with the use of sliding joints.\nWhen planning details for IMPs, prioritize air and wind tightness, the prevention of thermal bridges, resistance to rain penetration, aesthetic appearance, and durable fastening methods.\nFor IMP transverse joints, the upper panel should be cut back at least 200 mm, removing any foam or mineral wool in that area, and a 10mm thick closed-cell sealing tape should be installed.\nA spacer strip at least 4mm thick should be placed under the roof panel to create a drainage gap, and then two rows of sealing tape, Type 4, should be applied inside the joint.\nDo not install any fasteners in the low points of the corrugations at transverse joints, as this will damage the seal.\nPanel faces at transverse joints should never touch due to the risk of capillary action causing water ingress.\nTransverse joints should always be placed above a purlin to help support and seal them correctly.\nWhen using water diverters in the eaves, they must be properly installed to avoid ice buildup and water ingress.\nDrip edges should be installed along the eaves to allow for drainage.\nSnow guards should be installed in the purlins and should not be mounted below a transverse joint, or at the first or any other connection.\nIt is important to ensure a correct bearing width for IMPs on the purlins.\nFor IMPs, deflection must be taken into account, and they should not be restricted when supported.\nThe top edges of purlins should always be lower than the top of the supporting structure.\nFor horizontal IMP installations, any expansion will be in a vertical direction.\nA properly designed base for vertical wall panels should be thermally broken, and allow for the expansion and contraction of the panels.\nFor vertical wall panel installations, the panels must be free to expand vertically, and therefore, the panel must never be fixed directly to the ground.\nIf there is water ingress through the vertical joint between two IMPs, it should always be channeled to the outside of the structure.\nThe bottom edge of vertically installed panels should be cut at a 45-degree angle or have a water diverter installed to direct any water ingress outwards.\nThe bimetal effect is a function of the panel's external color, and occurs when the external skin expands or contracts faster than the internal skin.\nFor darker colored panels, a panel lifter should be used to help guide the panels together during installation, and also during expansion and contraction cycles.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs as fire barriers, fire-rated expansion joints must be installed and must also consider the bimetal effect.\nThe bimetal effect occurs when differing temperatures cause the inner and outer skins of an IMP to expand or contract differently from each other.\nWhen using panel press tools during IMP installation, be careful not to damage the panels.\nA horizontal wall connection must have a drip edge installed over the panels to allow water to flow away from the building.\nWhen making connections to windows, there should always be a gap to allow thermal expansion, and never direct attachment of the IMP to the window frame.\nFor window installations in IMP walls, the proper sealing should be done according to building codes (ÖNORM B 5320).\nThe edge of the IMP should always be sealed with a flexible sealant when attaching to window frames.\nWhen using a window installation that involves a jamb, a sill, or a head, the inner part of the window must be level with the insulation.\nInstallers are responsible to ensure that IMP installations conform to relevant building codes.\nWhen installing corner connections, install sealant on the inside, and a proper metal connection on the outside to ensure a weather tight joint.\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs with exposed cut surfaces such as at corners, use diffusion-open tape type 8 to seal, and prevent water absorption into the insulation.\nWhen using vertical supports for wall panels, make sure the supports have a bearing surface suitable for load transfer, which does not put pressure on the panels.\nWhen installing IMPs under an overhang, they must be free to expand, and not anchored to the bottom of the overhang.\nWhen installing horizontal panels under an overhang, the top of the panel should be sealed, and should also use a drip edge.\nWhen creating a roof penetration, the connection should be sealed using a pre-fabricated pipe collar.\nFor roof penetrations in IMPs, ensure that the penetration pipe is thermally broken to avoid thermal bridging and the creation of condensation.\nWhen installing snow guards, they should be installed directly to the purlins, not to the IMPs.\nSnow guards should not be installed directly below transverse joints in IMPs, or at the eave, because these locations are susceptible to water ingress due to ice buildup.\nWhen installing snow guards, proper planning should be considered so that water will still drain, and not overflow into the interior of the building, which can lead to damage.\nWhen using self-drilling fasteners, it is not permitted to directly screw into the low points of the IMPs due to poor sealing and a risk of water ingress.\nFor firewalls made of IMPs, ensure that the substructure is also fire resistant or fire retardant.\nThe load of a fire rated wall, including any wind loads, must not be transferred to the IMPs, and therefore, separate studs must be in place for the wall, as well as the IMP.\nWhen performing a roof penetration, the installer should ensure that the roof panels can expand and contract and not be obstructed by any of the other roof components.\nWhen performing roof penetration using mineral wool IMPs, the installer should take care to properly seal all cut edges.\nWhen using IMPs with a mineral wool core for fire protection, proper installation according to technical guidelines is essential.\nThe installer must obtain a certificate from the IMP manufacturer verifying the fire resistance of the panels, to ensure they are suitable for their intended use.\nThe proper installation of connections to adjacent building components is the responsibility of the installing company.\nMineral wool IMPs should have a fire rating of at least 1000°C, and be classified as non-combustible.\nThe longitudinal joint of roof panels should be sealed with a PE film (polyethylene) as a vapor barrier.\nA vapor barrier on roof panels stops warm air from penetrating into the insulation.\nFor mineral wool IMPs, condensation within the insulation can damage the product; therefore, this type of panel must be sealed.\nWhen installing IMPs, both sides of the lengthwise joints must be protected from moisture, with sealing tape, and all cut edges should be sealed to prevent thermal issues and water penetration.\nIf the vapor barrier is damaged, use a matte, opaque tape, which should be 50mm wide and be reinforced with acrylic adhesive to repair the surface, but ensure a qualified supplier is consulted before making a change.\nWhen making transverse joints in the roof, they must be sealed to prevent moisture ingress.\nA drip edge is required at the eave.\nThe exposed side of the roof panel at the eaves should be covered with a metal trim piece.\nThermal breaks, particularly at the point of connection of mineral wool IMPs should be made to reduce thermal conductivity and prevent the formation of condensation, where Dichtband is used for sealing (e.g. Würth Eurasol).\nWhen using mineral wool IMPs for walls and facades, there is a choice between visible and concealed fasteners.\nDue to the compressive properties of mineral wool, pressure distribution plates (backing plates or washers) should be used at the fixing points.\nA keystone cut, or V-cut, is needed on the exterior surface of the IMP at the base to prevent moisture from being absorbed by the mineral wool.\nWhen planning a building's connections, prevent the mineral wool from making contact with water.\nWhen making transverse joints with mineral wool IMPs, the mineral wool must be cut back in a V-shape in order to provide a proper seal and prevent water ingress.\nIf fasteners are used through the low points of a mineral wool IMP, this can allow a thermal bridge to be created, which can cause condensation.\nThe loads of upper panels must not be transferred to the lower panels directly.\nIMPs at the edges of a structure must be free to move, and have an expansion gap.\nA structural fire barrier must be made of fire-resistant material that complies with the fire resistance rating of the panels.\nThe brand load in building codes refers to the weight of materials that can burn.\nSubstructures must be made from non-combustible material, where the IMPs themselves are also fire rated, but may not be self-supporting.\nStuds and wall rails should be attached to the main structure in fire rated systems, to prevent collapse.\nBimetal Effect: The tendency of two different metals bonded together to bend when heated due to different rates of thermal expansion.\nCE Marking: A certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.\nDrip Edge: A metal flashing installed at the edge of a roof or overhang that extends beyond the face of the wall and allows water to drip clear of the structure.\nEaves: The lower edge of a roof that projects beyond the side of a building.\nEnergy Performance Certificate: A document that provides information about the energy efficiency of a building.\nIntumescent strips: Firestop strips that swell up when heated, to create a barrier.\nOIB Guidelines: Austrian guidelines for building regulations.\nPurlin: A horizontal structural member in a roof used to support the roof panels, but is itself supported by the roof structure.\nRAL Color System: A color matching system primarily used for paints and coatings across Europe.\nU-Value: A measure of how well a building element transmits heat, where a low value indicates better thermal performance.\nR-Value: A measure of a material's resistance to heat flow, where a high value indicates better thermal insulation.\nSelf-drilling fastener: A fastener that has a drilling point and does not require a pre-drilled hole.\nInsulated metal panels (IMPs), also called sandwich panels, are self-supporting, double-skin, metal-faced panels used for building envelopes and internal walls/ceilings.\nIMPs provide weather protection, aesthetic qualities, and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\nIMP cores vary and include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PUR), glass fiber, polyisocyanurate (PIR), mineral fiber, and hybrid PIR insulation technology.\nThe construction industry is trending towards more rigid, closed-cell insulation which has a low thermal conductivity due to the gas trapped within its cells, and this allows for thinner insulation layers to be used.\nAluminum composite material (ACM) panels, or metal composite material (MCM) panels, are flat panels or cassettes made of two thin aluminum sheets bonded to a core fill, primarily used for aesthetic qualities as part of a rainscreen facade system, but do not provide any insulation.\nACM panels use a core material of polyethylene, fire-retardant polyethylene, or mineral core.\nPolyethylene is a highly flammable thermoplastic material, and fire-retardant polyethylene contains 30% polyethylene and 70% mineral thermoplastic core, while mineral core contains less than 10% polyethylene.\nThermoplastic materials melt and drip when exposed to heat and are combustible and promote fire spread, whereas thermosetting materials form a char layer when exposed to heat and are more fire-resistant.\nOn exposure to a direct flame, hybrid PIR insulation forms a protective char layer that resists spread and self-extinguishes when the fire source is removed, and this char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\n\"Reaction to fire\" refers to how a material contributes to a fire through its decomposition, and relates to the combustibility and ignitability of a material, and is determined through small-scale tests.\nASTM E84 is a test used to determine the surface burning characteristics of building materials, including flame spread and smoke generation, where a low flame spread index (FSI) and smoke developed index (SDI) indicates better fire performance.\nASTM E119 tests the fire resistance of a complete wall assembly by measuring its ability to withstand heat and hot gasses over time, but it does not test for scalability, fire behavior between elements, smoke generation, the production of toxic gases, or spread over the surface.\nNFPA 285 tests the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall assemblies and panels used as components of curtain wall assemblies with combustible elements, and are used to evaluate complete building systems and are required for multi-story buildings.\nFM 4880 tests building panels and interior finish materials for fire resistance and classifies these as \"Class 1\" (with or without a height restriction).\nFM 4881 tests exterior wall systems for structural performance.\nFM 4882 tests interior wall and ceiling materials or systems for smoke-sensitive occupancies, and classifies these as \"Class 1\".\nFM 4471 tests structural performance for roof panels.\nFM 4882 and FM 4880 include tests for smoke generation.\nFM 4882 has a classification of a Class 1 Interior Wall and Ceiling Materials or Systems for Smoke-Sensitive Occupancies, and FM 4880 has a classification of a Class 1 Fire Rating of Building Panels or Interior Finish Materials.\nAccording to ASTM D1929, the best in class temperature at the point of ignition is 968°F with an average of 680°F.\nAccording to ASTM E84 the best in class flame spread index and smoke developed index is less than 25 and 50 respectively.\nFM 4880 Class 1 approval allows for installation at unlimited heights.\nFM 4882 approval is a prerequisite for using IMPs in smoke-sensitive occupancies.\nThe insurance industry requires full-scale fire testing to identify the fire performance of insulated panels, and has produced specific testing regimes for this purpose.\nFM Approvals is a recognized third-party testing and certification service for property loss prevention products and services in commercial and industrial facilities.\nFM Approvals are recognized by governments and regulatory bodies around the world.\nFM Approved sandwich panels have a superior fire rating and prevent the spread of fire within the panel itself, and, as such, can be compared to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\nThe FM approval process includes tests of the products and also audits of manufacturing facilities and quality control processes.\nFM Approved Class 1 insulated metal panel systems ensure that the envelope does not contribute to fire propagation, reduce the need for sprinklers, reduce flame spread and allow for direct fire damage to be localized, although this can depend on the content of and activities in the building.\nThe FM 4880 certification requires production and sample selection, a flammability characterization of the core, a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nFlashover is the stage in a contained fire where all exposed surfaces reach ignition temperatures simultaneously, causing rapid fire spread.\nPost-test examinations include measuring and recording the extent of damage to the panel faces, and charring of the core in fire damaged areas.\nThe 50ft corner test (FM 4880) is a large-scale fire test which uses a crib set in the corner of the test room, and measures fire propagation.\nThe 16 ft parallel panel test (FM 4882) measures smoke generation and is used to achieve unlimited height approvals and tests for smoke sensitive occupancies.\nPoorly installed penetrations such as pipes or conduit can threaten the fire performance of a system, and therefore it is important to use certified penetration seals to ensure proper fire resistance.\nThe proper installation of penetrations can achieve a fire resistance of up to 30 and even more than 60 minutes with a tested panel system.\nThe IBC (International Building Code) requires multistory wall assemblies (for Types I-IV construction) to be tested per NFPA 285.\nNFPA 285 testing may be conducted with or without gypsum on the interior of the wall.\nThe installed condition of the panel must comply with the tested configuration.\nAlthough IMPs are classified as combustible, they can be used in Types I-V construction when they have passed a large-scale fire test as specified in chapter 26 of the IBC.\nNFPA 285 tests are intended for use in evaluating multi-story wall assemblies, and now includes the evaluation of joints and seams in specified locations and the proper replication of those features in the field is required.\nThe NFPA 285 test does not consider other fire risks like roof penetration, HVAC, or window systems and therefore, these must be evaluated separately.\nIn 2018, there were a number of updates to NFPA 285: it is now used for all construction types I-V, it removes \"noncombustible\" as a criteria from tested walls, it allows for the use of wood construction, and specifies joint location, along with requiring fire rated window trim.\nNFPA 285 tests must have specific joint locations on panelized systems and also must consider how panels connect in a specific design and application.\nNFPA 285 tests include specific locations for horizontal and vertical joints on panel systems.\nNFPA 285 testing calibration is +/ - 10% to +20% of specified temperatures\nThe observation period after the NFPA 285 test is no longer required.\nA British Standard BS 8414 test was developed as an analog to the NFPA 285 test, and this test involves both a combustible and non-combustible insulation and both peak at approximately 650°C.\nBuilding regulations are updated and modified frequently and their impacts on cladding and insulation must be considered.\nThe specific regulatory requirements for each building depend on factors including building height, its distance to property lines, and jurisdiction-specific codes and therefore, local regulations must always be followed.\nThe use of IMPs is less restricted in Chapter 26 of the IBC compared to products that fall under Chapter 14.\nIn most conditions, IMPs are less restricted when it comes to interior applications when compared to other types of claddings.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals (per U.S. code) are determined by: FM 4880 (no height restriction); FM 4881 (structural testing of wall panels); FM 4882 (fire-resistant interior wall and ceiling systems); FM 4471 (structural testing of roof panels).\nThe test requirements for FM Global Class 1 approvals include: witness production and sample selection; flammability characterization of the core (FPA), a large scale corner test, a large scale room test, and small scale identification tests.\nIt is impossible to achieve a fully noncombustible cladding system, as all building systems include some form of combustible material.\nCase studies of actual fires, where IMPs are used as the cladding, show limited flame spread and limited smoke production, thereby proving the value of using these systems.\nThe fire performance of IMPs, when installed correctly and according to the manufacturers guidelines, will limit the spread and intensity of fires.\nFM Global Class 1 approvals allow for IMPs to be treated as being \"comparable to noncombustible panels for protection purposes.\"\nFM Class 1 approval has a specific process that entails an evaluation of the product, and audits of the manufacturing and quality control procedures.\nFM Approved systems ensure that the building envelope does not contribute to fire spread, and can also make sprinkler systems unecessary (though this may depend on the contents of the building).\nFM Approval requires testing of full systems, and not small-scale material testing, because it better represents real-world fire performance.\nFM 4880 is a prerequisite for products to achieve a class 1 rating.\nFM 4882 is a higher standard and a prerequisite for systems that will be used in smoke-sensitive environments.\nFM 4882 approved Class 1 systems will limit self-propagation of fire and generate less smoke, as compared to other insulated panel systems.\nFM 4882 approval also means the insulated panels are strong enough to be power washed.\nFM 4882 approved panels may allow for a reduction or elimination of sprinkler systems if the occupancy allows for it.\n\n\nANSWER

1:   \n\"user_question\":\"what type of fire reaction does globeroof eco offer?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The Globeroof Eco product offers a fire reaction that includes the formation of a protective layer when exposed to direct flame, which resists the spread of fire and self-extinguishes once the fire source is removed. This char layer acts as an insulating barrier between the external heat source and the unaffected insulation core.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"the answer should be B-s2,d0; but this one is not completely wrong, it explains what happens when the fire attacks the PIR foam\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"partially_correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 2:\n\"user_question\":\"Can the insulated panel be used outdoors?\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"Yes, insulated metal panels (IMPs) can be used outdoors. They are designed for constructing building envelopes for roofs and walls, providing weather protection and high levels of insulation and airtightness, which helps save energy and reduce carbon emissions.\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"nailed it\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":true,\n      \"result\":\"correct\"\n   }\n\nExample 3:\n\"user_question\":\"How much does the panel weigh? (Obviously depending on the thickness)\",\n\"bot_answer\":\"The weight of the Globe Roof insulated roofing panel will vary depending on the thickness of the steel gauge you choose. Here are the approximate weights for each thickness: For 0.4mm thickness: approximately 7.5 kg/m2. For 0.5mm thickness: approximately 9.0kg/m2. For 0.6mm thickness: approximately  10.5kg/m2. If you need further assistance or more specific details, feel free to ask!\",\nAssistant output: {\n      \"feedback\":\"Bot is responding with thickness of metal cladding, not thickness of the insulation core. Since the insulating core thickness is one of the primary features of an IMP, it should be assumed that its thickness is being asked about, not the metal cladding thickness.\",\n      \"is_fully_correct\":false,\n      \"result\":\"incorrect\"\n   }\n\nQUESTION/ANSWER PAIR FOR EVALUATION:\n\n\nuser question: Does GlobeRoof PIR or PUR Have Noise Absorption Properties?\n\nbot answer: **No, GlobeRoof PIR or PUR does not have noise absorption properties.** \n\nGlobeRoof panels with PIR (Polyisocyanurate) or PUR (Polyurethane) cores are designed primarily for thermal insulation and structural performance, but they do not absorb noise. Instead, they reflect sound, which can contribute to noise bounce-back inside a building rather than reducing it.\n\n### The Correct Solution for Noise Absorption: GlobeRoof Noisestop\nIf noise absorption is a priority, the best option is **GlobeRoof Noisestop**, which is specifically engineered for sound absorption and noise reduction.\n\n- **How GlobeRoof Noisestop Works:**\n  - Designed with perforated internal facings to allow sound waves to enter.\n  - Special acoustic insulation inside absorbs sound instead of reflecting it.\n  - Reduces echo and reverberation, making it ideal for industrial buildings, gyms, and noisy environments.\n\n### When to Use GlobeRoof Noisestop Instead of PIR/PUR Panels?\n- If you need to control noise levels inside a building (factories, auditoriums, warehouses).\n- If you want to prevent echo and improve acoustic comfort.\n- If your project requires compliance with sound absorption standards.\n\n### Final Answer:\n- 🚫 Standard GlobeRoof PIR or PUR panels do not absorb noise.\n- ✅ If noise absorption is needed, choose **GlobeRoof Noisestop**."}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"response_format":{"type":"json_object"},"metadata":{"conversation_id":"b2aaf182-c1b9-48e8-b960-df6040c14f8c","question_id":"b2aaf182-c1b9-48e8-b960-df6040c14f8c"}}}
