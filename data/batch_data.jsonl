However, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Insulation Type**:\n   - **PIR and PUR**: Both types of insulation provide thermal insulation, which can help in reducing the transmission of sound to some extent, but they are not specifically designed for soundproofing.\n\n2. **Panel Structure**:\n   - The overall structure of the panel, including the thickness and the materials used for the external and internal facings, can influence sound transmission. Thicker panels may offer slightly better sound insulation compared to thinner ones.\n\n3. **Noise Reduction**:\n   - While the panels can help reduce noise from external sources (like rain or wind), they are not classified as soundproofing materials. For projects where noise absorption is a critical requirement, additional soundproofing measures or materials may be necessary.\n\n4. **Applications**:\n   - If noise control is a significant concern for your project, consider consulting with an acoustic specialist to explore additional soundproofing options that can be integrated with the GlobeRoof panels.\n\nIn summary, while GlobeRoof PIR and PUR panels provide some level of noise reduction due to their insulation properties, they are not specifically designed for noise absorption.

Here are the key details about the gasket type:\n\n1. **Primary Gasket**: \n   - **Material**: Hollow EPDM seal.\n   - **Integration**: This gasket is integrated into the panel during production.\n   - **Performance**: It is highly flexible even at low temperatures (down to -40°C) and is resistant to chemicals and aging.\n\n2. **Secondary Seal**: \n   - **Material**: A single-component thixotropic polyurethane or silicone mastic.\n   - **Application**: This seal is applied on-site to provide elastic bonding between the metal facings.\n\n### Benefits of the Gasket System:\n- **Prevents Air Infiltration**: The EPDM gasket creates a tight seal that prevents outside air from being sucked in due to negative pressure in cold storage environments.\n- **Eliminates Condensation**: By blocking humid air infiltration, it prevents condensation inside panel joints, which can lead to ice formation and thermal inefficiency.\n- **Enhances Energy Efficiency**: The airtightness ensures that cold air stays inside, reducing the workload on refrigeration systems.\n\nThis innovative gasket system is crucial for maintaining the performance and durability of the GLOBEWALL FREEZE in cold storage applications.

Properly spaced purlins and beams distribute the load and maintain panel integrity.\n\n2. **Wind & Snow Resistance**: Structural supports prevent excessive deflection under wind uplift and snow loads. Panels installed on unsupported spans may deform over time.\n\n3. **Fastening & Stability**: Roof panels are mechanically fixed to structural supports for secure attachment. Without a stable substructure, fasteners may fail, leading to leaks or detachment.\n\n4. **Types of Structures Required**:\n   - **Purlins (Steel or Wooden)**: Provide horizontal support across the span of the roof.\n   - **Rafters or Trusses**: Offer primary load distribution in pitched roof systems.\n   - **Steel Framework for Industrial Buildings**: Large-scale structures typically use galvanized steel purlins and rafters to support the panels.\n\nIn summary, roof panels must be installed over a stable support structure to ensure their performance and longevity."}],"max_completion_tokens":5000,"metadata":{"conversation_id":"conv_01JMHMY1FDKHA27A53RKWJSBMV","question_id":"conv_01JMHMY1FDKHA27A53RKWJSBMV"}}}

Here are some general recommendations based on the load tables for GlobeRoof:\n\n### General Recommendations for Structural Support Spacing:\n- **For General Industrial Roofing**: Use purlins every **2.5 – 4.0 meters** based on the thickness of the panel.\n- **For High Wind/Snow Regions**: Reduce spacing to **1.5 – 2.5 meters** for extra strength.\n- **For Large Spans (>6m)**: Consult a structural engineer to verify deflection limits and fastener requirements.\n\n### Factors Affecting Structural Support Spacing:\n1. **Wind Loads**: High-wind areas may need closer purlin spacing (every **1.5 – 2.5 m**).\n2. **Snow Loads**: In heavy snow regions, reduce the span to prevent excessive panel deflection.\n3. **Roof Accessibility**: If the roof is walkable, spacing must be adjusted to accommodate maintenance loads.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Ensure that the actual support spacing is determined based on the expected loads (wind, snow, maintenance traffic, etc.).\n- Corner and edge zones may require closer spacing due to higher wind suction forces.\n- Multiple span configurations can increase load-bearing efficiency.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can help prevent damage to the GlobeRoof panels and ensure their structural integrity.
